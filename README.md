### Important:

- Do not forget any fields.
- Strings **must be enclosed in double quotes `" "`**.
- Integers **must NOT be enclosed in quotes**.
- The `Recipients` field accepts multiple emails, separated by commas, each inside quotes.
- The password in the `Password` field should be kept secure and **never shared publicly**.
- For Gmail with two-factor authentication, use an **app password** instead of your normal password.

## SMTP Configuration Examples

### Gmail

- **Host:** `smtp.gmail.com`
- **Port:** `587` (TLS) or `465` (SSL)
- **User:** your full Gmail email (e.g., `myemail@gmail.com`)
- **Password:** your app password (if using two-factor authentication) or your normal password (not recommended)
- **Sender:** sender email, usually the same as user

**Tips:**

- If you use two-factor authentication on Gmail, **create an app password** for this system.
- Enable access for less secure apps if not using two-factor authentication (not recommended).
- Prefer port 587 with TLS.

---

### Outlook / Hotmail / Microsoft 365

- **Host:** `smtp.office365.com`
- **Port:** `587` (TLS)
- **User:** your full Outlook email (e.g., `myemail@outlook.com`)
- **Password:** your normal password or app password
- **Sender:** sender email, usually the same as user

**Tips:**

- Use port 587 with TLS.
- You may need to configure permissions in your account to allow external SMTP.

## How to Run

Open a terminal in the project folder and run the command below, passing the stock symbol, sell price (upper limit), and buy price (lower limit) as arguments:

```bash
dotnet run -- <STOCK_SYMBOL> <SELL_PRICE> <BUY_PRICE>
```

### Example:

```bash
dotnet run -- PETR4 22.67 22.59
```

The program will continuously monitor the stock price and send email alerts whenever the price crosses the defined limits.

### üõ†Ô∏è Publish and Run the Project

To compile the project and generate an executable `.exe`, follow these steps:

#### 1. Publish the project

In the terminal inside the project folder, run:

```bash
dotnet publish -c Release -o publish
```

- This will generate the compiled files in the `publish/` folder, including the executable `stock-quote-alert.exe`.

#### 2. Run the `.exe`

In the terminal, navigate to the `publish` folder:

```bash
cd publish
```

Now run the program with the desired parameters (example with the stock PETR4):

```bash
.\stock-quote-alert.exe PETR4 22.67 22.59
```

- `PETR4` is the stock symbol
- `22.67` is the upper target price (sell limit)
- `22.59` is the lower target price (buy limit)
