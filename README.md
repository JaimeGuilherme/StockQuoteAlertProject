### üõ†Ô∏è Publish and Run the Project

To compile the project and generate an executable `.exe`, follow these steps:

#### 1. Publish the project

In the terminal, inside the project folder, run:

```bash
dotnet publish -c Release -o publish
```

- This will generate the compiled files in the `publish/` folder, including the executable `stock-quote-alert.exe`.

#### 2. Run the `.exe`

In the terminal, navigate to the `publish` folder:

```bash
cd publish
```

Now, run the program with the desired parameters (example with the asset PETR4):

```bash
.\stock-quote-alert.exe PETR4 22.67 22.59
```

- `PETR4` is the ticker symbol
- `22.67` is the upper price target (sell threshold)
- `22.59` is the lower price target (buy threshold)
